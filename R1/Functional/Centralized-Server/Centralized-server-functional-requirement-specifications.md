# Centralized server functional requirement specifications

## Introduction

This document describes the centralized server functional specifications. The server collects Logger's data and provide a secure access to this data for a Consumer.
For this, the server is composed by third main components :
- Collector API
- Consumer API
- Authentication API

## Use case

## Installation management

### Collector API

This API is WebService to collect, adjust and store data from an external Keylogger. In the first time, the keylogger is identified with a ClientID.
Next, it sends the data to the Collector API stores store the data in the SGBD.

The data of communication is defined here[here](../Collected data format/collected data format.md).

### Consumer API

This API is WebService that provide an access to the stored data. In the first step, the consumer has to identified the user. The second step isn't required, but it's necessary the first launch. 
The consumer subscribe some groups of computer to the user. Finally, the consumer can access to the data of computer subscribed to the connected user.

### Authentication API

This API is the kernel of the security in the system. The first role is authentified the computer and the user, but it manages also what computer data can access the user.
For this, during the installation of the keylogger, a ClientID is generated by the Authentication API and displayed to the user.
After the user can subscribed some groups of computer with the ClientID to access the data.
